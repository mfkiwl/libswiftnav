==============================================
Welcome to libswiftnav-python's documentation!
==============================================

`Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ bindings to the `libswiftnav
<http://github.com/swift-nav/libswiftnav>`_ GNSS library.

The full documentation for `libswiftnav` is available at
http://docs.swift-nav.com/libswiftnav/.

Some effort has been made to create a 'pythonic' interface without diverging
too far from the underlying C library. This documentation aims to cover the
Python API, highlighting the differences from the C API. Please refer to the
`libswiftnav` documentation for a description of the algorithms implemented.
